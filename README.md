# States And State Capitals Trivia
## Overview
#### Today you'll be using Java Streams, Collections, and lambda functions to figure out some state trivia. Unlike your other labs, you won't be building anything today, or have to code any tests. All the tests are already set up for you! You just have to make them pass.

## How you can run my code 

#### 1- Clone this repo
#### 2- Open the project in your Java IDE.
#### 3- Navigate to the StatesAndCapitalsTest class file.
#### 4- Run the code (Test Class) and watch the result.
#### 5- If you want to see my code directly go [here](https://github.com/MohamadSamara/statesAndCapitals/blob/main/lib/src/main/java/statesAndCapitals/StatesAndCapitals.java).
